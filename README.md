# Integration Exercise: Java Library Wrapper

I am wrapping the [jOpenDocument library] (http://www.jopendocument.org/). It's a library for creating and modifying Open Document files. So spreadsheets and texts.

## Exercise Summary

- You should create a gem using JRuby that wraps an existing Java library.
- Your gem should work with a Java library that doesn't already have
  a good wrapper.
- You should make the API for your library look and feel like Ruby, not Java.
