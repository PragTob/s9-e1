# Integration Exercise: Java Library Wrapper

I am wrapping the [ODFDOM] (http://odftoolkit.org/projects/odfdom/pages/Home). It's a library for creating and modifying Open Document files. So spreadsheets, texts and presentations. Not sure if all of these will be in the final release.

*ODF* stands for Open Document Format

Btw. ODFDOM seems to have a pretty decent [beginners guide] (http://www.langintro.com/odfdom_tutorials/index.html).
The javadoc may be found [here] (http://odfdom.odftoolkit.org/0.8.7/odfdom/apidocs/index.html)

## Exercise Summary

- You should create a gem using JRuby that wraps an existing Java library.
- Your gem should work with a Java library that doesn't already have
  a good wrapper.
- You should make the API for your library look and feel like Ruby, not Java.
